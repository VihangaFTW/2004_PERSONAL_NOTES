max digits = log 10 (1000) = 10^3
This indicates that 1000 has 3 digits but we know it has 4 digits.


The discrepancy arises due to the way we count digits and the way logarithms work.

When we count digits, we start from 1. For example, the number 10 has two digits, and the number 100 has three digits.

However, when we calculate logarithms, we start from 0. The logarithm of a number to a certain base is the power to which the base must be raised to get that number. For example, the logarithm of 10 to the base 10 is 1, because 10 to the power of 1 is 10. Similarly, the logarithm of 100 to the base 10 is 2, because 10 to the power of 2 is 100.

=========================================================================================================================== 

The logarithm function, denoted as log_b(a), essentially asks the question: "To what exponent must we raise the base b to get the number a?" 

And yes, exponents start from 0 because any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 equals 1. This is why log_b(1) = 0 for any base b. 

So, when you're dealing with whole numbers and a base b, the logarithm function will start from 0 (when the number a is 1) and increase as a increases. This is why we sometimes say "logarithms start from 0". 

============================================================================================================================

So, when a number is an exact power of the base, the logarithm gives us one less than the number of digits. This is because the logarithm is counting the number of times we multiply the base to get the number, starting from the base to the power of 0 (which is 1).

Thatâ€™s why we add 1 to the result of the logarithm when the number is an exact power of the base. This corrects the off-by-one error and gives us the correct number of digits
