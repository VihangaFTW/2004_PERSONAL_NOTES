1. **Radix Sort Columns**: In Radix Sort, the number of columns or digits, denoted as `k`, is determined by the largest number `M` in the list. Specifically, `k` is equal to the number of digits in `M`. If we represent numbers in base `b`, then `k = log_b(M)`. Now, if we choose `b = N` (where `N` is the length of the input list), then `k = log_N(M)`. If `M` is a function of `N` such that `M = N^c` for some constant `c`, then `k = log_N(N^c) = c`. So, `k` can indeed be a constant if `M` is a function of `N`.
2. **Base Value for Linear Runtime**: The runtime of Radix Sort is `O(kN)`, where `k` is the number of digits and `N` is the length of the list. To ensure a linear runtime, we want `k` to be a constant. As explained above, this can be achieved by choosing the base `b = N`. However, this is under the assumption that `M = N^c` for some constant `c`. If `M` is not a function of `N`, then `k` could potentially grow with `N`, leading to a non-linear runtime.

# **Example**

Suppose we have a list of `N = 10` numbers, but the largest number `M` in the list is `1000000`. If we choose the base `b = N = 10`, then the number of digits `k` in `M` when represented in base `b` would be `k = log_b(M) = log_10(1000000) = 6`.

Now, if we increase `N` to `20` (while keeping `M` constant at `1000000`), and again choose `b = N = 20`, then `k = log_b(M) = log_20(1000000) ≈ 4.8`, which is less than `6`.

So, in this case, `k` is not constant even though we are choosing `b = N`. It's decreasing as `N` increases. This is because `M` is not a function of `N`. If `M` were a function of `N`, say `M = N^2`, then `k` would remain constant as `N` increases.

# **The relationship between M (the largest number in the list) and N (the length of the list) is determined by the input data, not by the base we choose for Radix Sort.**

When we say “M is a function of N”, it means that the value of M depends on the value of N. For example, if M = N^2, then M is a function of N because M changes as N changes.

However, changing the base of Radix Sort does not change this relationship. The base in Radix Sort is used to determine the number of digits (k) in the numbers we are sorting. If we choose a base larger than N, it doesn’t make M a function of N. It simply means that we are representing the numbers in a larger base, which could affect the efficiency of the sort.

In other words, the base we choose for Radix Sort can affect the runtime of the algorithm, but it doesn’t change the inherent relationship between M and N in the input data.
